# My AwsomeWM configuration #


This is my [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) configuration. It
it greatly inspired by the one of [Vincent Bernat](https://github.com/vincentbernat/awesome-configuration).

This configuration is for _awesome_ 3.5.

Here some of the things you may be interested in:
* It is modular. I am using `config` as a table to pass different things between "modules".
* It displays notifications when changing volume, brightness and Xrandr outputs

## TODO : ##
