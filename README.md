Vincent Bernat's awesome configuration
--------------------------------------

This is my [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) configuration. It
does not exactly feature the same keybindings as the default
configuration. I don't recommend using it by you can pick anything you
need in it.

I rely on machine hostname for some configuration parts (see
`start.lua`) for the most important part.
