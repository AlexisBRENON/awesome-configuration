Alexis BRENON's awesome configuration
--------------------------------------

This is my [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) configuration. It
it greatly inspired by the one of [Vincent Bernat](https://github.com/vincentbernat/awesome-configuration).

This configuration is for _awesome_ 3.5.

Here some of the things you may be interested in:

 - It is modular. I am using `config` as a table to pass different
   things between "modules".

 - I am using `xautolock` as a screensaver.

 - I am using notifications when changing volume or brightness. I am
   also using notifications to change xrandr setup. This is pretty
   cool.
